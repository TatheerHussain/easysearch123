This once-desolate spring has been made into an ecological wetland in the shape of double hearts, and is very lovely. Next, turn a small corner, and the scene before you resembles another country – this is the Farmhouse Cafe Trattoria (穠舍田園咖啡義大利菜), founded by a local farmer, Lin James. Lin's ancestors and parents lived and ran a farm here, but following the development of tourism in the Baishihu Lake community, he changed the old farmhouse hidden in a bamboo forest into a restaurant with its own inimitable style, and installed equipment for kids' games like hopscotch outside, allowing everyone to share in the fun here.
 
 The lunch dishes provided are also very characterful. For example, the spinach fettuccine and flat fettuccine, which combine olive oil with fried fresh seasonable vegetables, giving every bite a great natural taste; this aside, the series of dishes made with the farm's own strawberries, such as strawberry pancake and strawberry au lait, can't be missed. No pesticides or growth hormones are added to the strawberries, which are small, sweet, tart and juicy. Combined with fresh hand-made cream, they warm the heart and delight the eyes, and also taste great.

385,Songshan Cultural and Creative Park 松山文創園區,"The 6.6-hectares Songshan Cultural and Creative Park in Taipei’s Xinyi District was completed in 1937 as the Songshan Tobacco Factory, which was one of the seed companies of a monopoly system mandated by the Taiwan Governor-General Office. The premises were one of Taiwan’s pioneers of modern industry, as well as the first professional tobacco plant. A gracefully simple Japanese modernist structure, the factory features meticulously crafted face cams, glasswork and bronze nails that made it arguably a “model factory” at that time. When Japan lost the war in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it, Songshan Tobacco Factory of Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. The factory ceased production of cigarettes in 1998 for concerns over urban planning, regulatory changes in the tobacco and liquor marketing system, as well as shrinking demand. It became a relic of the past after being merged into the Taipei Cigarette Plant.
 In 2001, the Taipei City Government named the tobacco factory the city’s 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites (namely the office building, the 1st to 5th warehouses, cigarette plant and boiler room), historic structures (the inspection room, a machinery repair shed and a nursing room) and architectural highlights (the Baroque-style garden, an ecologically landscaped pond, a public bath and a multi-purpose auditorium). For more efficient reuse of space, the Songshan Cultural and Creative Park was built on the historic site as a production base for designers and cultural & creative businesses, as well as a venue for performances and exhibitions. The park introduced to its premises a Taiwan Design Museum and TMSK through partnerships with the Taiwan Design Center and prestigious Taiwanese glasswork label LIULI GONG FANG, respectively, besides a snack bar that was converted from the machinery repair shed.

 The Tianmu Historic Trail meanders through the northwestern slope of Shilin’s Huagang area as well as the saddle to the south of Shamao Mountain. As the second half of the previous Yulu Historic Trail, the Tianmu Historic Trail comprises several footpaths that connect Huagang and Tianmu along a water main. These footpaths are perfect for a refreshing summer hike with the murmuring creek running through a pristine forest nearby. People who seek cool, tree-shaded trails may as well take the Cuifeng Trail and stop by Cuifeng Waterfall before reaching Houdong Industrial Road.
 
 Once a major transportation corridor between Jinshan and Tianmu, the Tianmu Historic Trail has literally become an “old trail” since the inauguration of Yangde Blvd. and, in recent years, has been crowded with sightseers every weekend.
 
 Ecological phenomena along the Tianmu Historic Trail
 At an altitude of 300 to 120 meters, Tianmu Historic Trail features a broadleaf forest ecosystem typical of the low-altitude, subtropical Taiwan. Northeastern monsoons and the attendant gales, rainfall and low temperatures coming from the saddle of Datun Mountain helped to create a warm-temperate broadleaf forest along the trail on the windward hillside. The shady and humid valley on the leeward side, nevertheless, encourages the growth of tropical broadleaf trees and such tropical phenomena as the buttress roots, cauliflory, and Strangling plants. Although the trail is located only at 300 meters above sea level, it boasts a rarely-seen, compact ecosystem that simultaneously comprises broadleaf forests of tropical, subtropical and warm-temperate biomes.
 
 ◎Warning for hikers: When you reach a fork in the path leading downward toward Cuifeng Waterfall, do NOT feed the monkeys that frequently show up in groups because they may hurt you while fighting for food!

416,Chen Tian-Lai's Residence 陳天來故居,"Gui’de Street symbolizes tea-enabled wealth and boom in Dadaocheng, which was among Taiwan’s most prosperous regions in the early days. As one of the many businessmen who earned enviable amounts of fortune in the country’s tea business, Chen Tian-lai founded Jinji Tea Co. and reinvested his profits in the entertainment industry, such as theaters. The current Chen Tian-lai Residence at No. 73, Gui’de Street used to house the former Jinji Tea Co. This three-story Baroque structure was completed in 1920 with the first floor dedicated to tea trading, the second floor serving as a guesthouse for tea-traders, and the third floor as private residence. The main structure of this imposing European-style house, flanked by guard towers on both sides, as well as classic colonnade and arched hallway, is adorned with baroque details as festoons and balconies. This historic residence used to be a renowned tea party spot in Dadaocheng, where tea-traders met regularly at the guesthouse to enjoy the view at the Tamsui Wharf in the distance. Behind the Residence, a private garden adjacent to Gang-zi Ditch (the present-day Xining North Road) bears testimony to the heyday of Dadaocheng in the first half of the 20th century.

417,Old storefront buildings on Dihua St. 迪化街店屋,"Bangka (Monga) was the first port in Taipei before the once-massive Tamsui River was silted up due to the upper-stream settlements. After losing an ethnic clash (i.e., Ding-Xia-Jiao-Ping) in 1853, immigrants from Fujian’s Tongan region were forced out of Bangka by the Sanyi immigrants, also from Fujian, to settle in Dadaocheng. As the trade input between China and the West reached a record high, Dadaocheng replaced the inaccessible Bangka as a major port and prosperous business district.
 
 Stores selling goods from China mushroomed along Dihua Street, which is situated behind the riverfront-facing Guide Street. Overnight, wealth prompted the Dihua Street-based businessmen to erect opulent houses with arcades adapted to the rainy climate. In addition to the intriguing eclectic facades that are decorated in Western style, these old storefront houses are best known for being extremely narrow and deep. Behind each storefront is a factory or a warehouse, lending an air of distinction to this cluster of old-fashioned housing complex.","Section 1, Dihua St., Datong Dist., Taipei City Taiwan, R.O.C",Daqiaotou,https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/572,

The overall decoration lacks complexity, yet fineness can be found in its simple, understated beauty. The architectural design of the building was deeply influenced by the classical European style. The first floor of the structure was built using heavy piling of stone materials laid to form an elegant arcade of four columns and three spaces, where the arches are composed of trapezoid Qili’an rocks. Patterns pieced together by wood can be found in the arcade ceiling. The second floor and roof trusses are all made of wood, covered with pieces of asbestos tiles on the mansard roof. The outward appearance features steep roof and dormers on the façade, as well as stone arcade columns. It is an imitation of a Renaissance style building and is the only remaining detached western-style shop still extant today that was built during the Japanese Colonial Period.

Qigu, Mt. Ding and Mt. Huangzui that used to be a terrace formed by lava from Mt. Zhugao. Qingtiangang was designated by Japanese colonial rulers as the site of the Dalingzhi Ranch for tea-growing and cattle-herding purposes. After taking over Taiwan, the Chinese nationalist government established the Yangmingshan Ranch in the Qingtiangang /Lengshuikeng area, following the original Japanese tradition. Once Taipei City was placed under the administration of the Executive Yuan, the Taipei City Farmers’ Association became responsible for the ranch operations, with the cattle herds on Qingtiangang being owned by farmers in Beitou, Shilin and Jinshan. With gently rolling meadows and dazzling verdancy, the evenly surfaced Qingtiangang is a wonderful outdoor classroom for grassland observation, and the most popular hiking destination in Yangmingshan National Park, with a foot path impressively lined with undulating grass and stumpy shrubs.
Notes for visitors:
For your safety, keep your distance from the wild cattle on the Qingtiangang Grassland.
Qingtiangang has unstable weather conditions; mountaineers/hikers are advised to carry rain gear and warm clothing.

The entire valley maintains almost the same ecological landscape that existed more than a hundred years ago. There are abundant plants in the park, with insects calling and birds singing, where natural resources such as low-elevation forests and streams are also preserved. The rare ecological park in the City is divided into several areas: Natural Succession Area, Butterfly Watching Area, Formosan Giant Flying Squirrel Observation Area and Taipei Tree Frog Observation Area. Other than tree frogs, butterflies and Formosan Giant Flying Squirrels, the Park has a total of 5000 trees covering 331 plant species, such as: Incense machilus (Machilus zuihensis), Formosa acacia (Acacia confusa), Turn In The Wind (Mallotus paniculatus), Elephant’s Ear (Macaranga tanarius), etc. In the surroundings, there are houses of the military dependents’ village, preserved forts, culverts and vicissitudinous stone steps. Marks of painstaking efforts made by the military officers are clearly evident.

Located at the geological center of Yangmingshan National Park, this building offers a spectacular view of the Taipei Basin in the distance. A pond in front of the building, observable from the second-floor veranda, is children’s favorite as they are allowed to feed the varicolored carp in it. Adding quaint and solemnly elegant appeal to Gaungfu Building are exquisite carvings, paintings and numerous other typical Chinese architectural details that subtly made references to literature classics. When the flowers are in full bloom, the building becomes an island in a sea of cherry blossom petals. So just indulge yourself in this phenomenon by lingering around the circuitous corridors while appreciating the interplay between blossoms and the elusive mountain mist.

424,The Grand Hotel 圓山飯店,"The century-old golden dragons
The bronze dragons were initially desgined statues guarding the entrance to Taiwan Jinjia (built in 1901 in the style of a Japanese Shinto shrine). They were carefully preserved during re-constructions of the Grand Hotel, to be later perfectly displayed in the hotel’s Gold Dragon Restaurant; the dragons were accentuated with 24-karat gold plating as part of the hotel’s renovation efforts in 1987. It is worth noting that these dragons have three claws only, compared to the four or five claws on dragons depicted in traditional Chinese paintings.
Plum-flower caisson ceiling
On the center of the hotel lobby’s ceiling is a plum blossom-shaped caisson, with five golden dragons encircling a pearl, suggesting the “Five Blessings.” Inspired by the Chinese pronunciation of “3” sounding like “rise” and the number 16 plus the large plum blossom, the 23 golden dragons and 16 phoenixes in the caisson were deliberately designed to signify rising to prominence and continuous profits, respectively. The caisson ceiling is also a profound traditional symbol of prosperity, represented by the dragons and phoenixes.
Upturned eaves and bucket arch
On the rooftop, both the upturned eaves and bucket arch embody ancient Chinese culture. While a row of animals crouch above the vertical ridge of the dramatically upturned eaves, the Chiwei, or monster-like ornaments made from roofing shingles, are poised between the main ridge and vertical ridge. The sumptuously delicate yet robust bucket arch structure under the roof is one of the greatest wonders in Chinese architecture.
Glass doors of the hotel lobby
The gigantic, yet gracefully symmetrical, floor-to-ceiling glass doors of the lobby serve as the front entrance of The Grand Hotel. Look closely, and you will see six ancient Chinese characters signifying “Long Live the Republic of China”, hidden under the decorative patterns. The creativity of the design and how times have changed are surely impressive, considering the historical background of the hotel.
Stone tablet
Erected at the beginning of a stone staircase leading to the arched entrance is a giant stone tablet inscribed with the cursive-style characters “Jian-Tan-Sheng-Ji”. After verification from various sources, the words depicted in the free-flowing and powerful calligraphic work of the late politician Yu You-ren, are believed to mean that the Yuanshan area is sanctified, which offers an explanation for the Grand Hotel remaining popular and revered over the past century.","No. 1, Sec. 4, Zhongshan N.

The neighborhood was notorious for ITS outdated amenities and a substandard lifestyle that left the city unsightly.

It also implemented the Tobacco and Liquor Monopoly Act to govern the organization, the tobacco and liquor distribution units as well as the approved retailers throughout Taiwan. The Bureau performed very well in product marketing and sales through the years, and the profit brought into the treasury became an important tax revenue source for the country. 
In recent years, in response to internationalization and liberalization, the Government abolished the monopoly system on January 1st, 2002, and restructured the bureau into “Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Corporation” on July 1st, 2002. This building, which has witnessed the history of Taiwan’s monopoly system, was designated as a historical site by the Ministry of the Interior in 1998.","No.4, Section 1, Nanchang Road, Zhongzheng Dist., Taipei City Taiwan, R.O.C",Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall,https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/556,

430,Marshal Zen Garden 少帥禪園,"Marshal Zen Garden, nestled in the shaded foothills of the Beitou area, was completed halfway through the Japanese colonial period as the Xin Gao Hotel, a complex of two structures with gray roofing and wooden walls where socialites indulged in lavish banquets and hot spring baths. During World War II, the hotel was converted into a reception hall for Japanese Kamikaze pilots before their suicide operations. In the 1960s, after Taiwan was returned to the rule of the nationalist government, General Zhang Xueliang was placed under house arrest along with his wife at the site by then-president Chiang Kai-shek for organizing the Xi’an Incident, in which Zhang emphasized his belief that fighting against the Japanese invasion should be a top priority. The location of the house arrest was renovated in 1984 into a Zen Garden to preserve Beitou’s historic details that prevailed in architecture over the last few centuries, and then converted into what is now the martial-themed Marshal Zen Garden. Due to its relatively higher altitude, the restaurant overlooks the entire Beitou hot-spring zone and Guanyinshan. When the weather permits, patrons can see the landscape against the dazzling backdrop of sunset, and enjoy delicacies from a classic menu made famous by Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, while at the same time, the site boasts an endless supply of white sulphur spring, a local specialty, in private bathrooms; it is an awesome destination for ecological, historical, sightseeing or culinary tours.

Having survived the Japanese colonialist offensives that ruined much of the city’s protective structures, though, the South Gate, nevertheless, was starting to show signs of age. A Nationalist Government’s attempt to restore its façade in the Northern Chinese palatial style totally changed its looks but, fortunately, preserved both the masonry foundation and round opening in the wall. Located beside the Class-1 historic site of Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau at the intersection of Gongyuan Rd., Nanchang St and Aiguo W.

She was revered as “ the mother of Taiwanese modern dance” because of her 500-odd productions that cover genres ranging from ballet to folk dances of all ethnicities; the productions she helped inspired include: “The Song of India” and “We Love Our Taiwan”. The historic structure of Tsai Jui-yueh Dance Research Institute was one of the tens of dormitories for Japanese colonial officials built around 1925 on Zhongshan N. Rd. and downtown Taipei; they were mostly wooden, Japanese-style duplexes. In 1953, Tsai purchased this former residence of a Japanese “Haninkan” official, with part of the house designated for choreographic rehearsals. She went on to convert it into a dance studio. In 1999, scholars insisted that Tsai’s dance studio, once destroyed in a fire and coveted by real estate developers, should be restored as a historic site in homage to Taiwanese modern dance.

457,Bangka Park 艋舺公園,"Previously known as Park No. 12 located in the Wanhua District, the sprawling Bangka Park next to Longshan Temple is enclosed by Guangzhou St., Heping W. Rd., Sanshui St. and Xiyuan Rd. Developed by the Taipei City Government, it is a distinctively art-themed “folklore park” teeming with culturally significant details. For example, a dragon-inspired sculpture in the Park’s east side is inspired by a Chinese Feng Shui rule for good luck, being an azure dragon appearing on the left-hand side when facing south, while a boat sculpture in the west side recount a bit of history of the early settlers in the neighborhood who used canoes as a common means of transportation, ferrying and trade. Adjacent to a pond named “Beauty’s Mirror” is a viewing platform defined by Feng Shui principles in accordance with the position of the Big Dipper constellation, where illuminated “dancing water” shows are staged on a daily basis. After sunset, the Temple Gateway Square, an extension of the Longshan Temple into the Park’s north side, sees over 2,000 stars simultaneously radiating lights of varying colors from an astrological chart that consists of both Chinese and Western zodiac signs. Meanwhile, the roof tile-like structure of reinforced glass and vitreous enamel panels transforms the Park’s inverted U-shaped art gallery into a passageway with recreation and exhibition facilities. As an important public project in the City Government’s campaign of “Rotating the Axis of Urban Development and Regenerating Taipei West”, Bangka Park, along with its neighboring Longshan Temple, will hopefully blossom into a vibrant international tourist hotspot of historical, cultural and religious importance that buttresses western Taipei’s growth and business potential, and ultimately regains the glory of this two-century-old neighborhood.

 Type: Residence
 Built in the 2nd Year of Emperor Guangxu (1876 AD)
 
 Yifangju Estate was built by the early settlers of the Chen family. The Chen family’s ancestors came from Anxi County, Quanzhoufu of Fujian Province. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the early Chen members traveled to Taiwan as pioneers. It wasn’t until the early Guangxu era that they invested a huge sum of money to construct the Yifangju Estate. This traditional sanheyuan (a three-section compound) was typical of the ancient residences of the Taipei basin area. The main hall was constructed in a U-shape design; the walls of the main hall and ancillary halls (to the left and right of the main hall) were built with bricks, and few windows and doors were present. In addition, a firearms cabinet was built on the second floor of the ancillary halls to guard the residence against robbers. Furthermore, most of the window frames were made with rocks produced in Taipei. The door plate of the residence indicated that it was constructed around the 2nd year of Emperor Guangxu. Due to the rapid modernization of Taipei City, traditional residences like Yifangju Estate continue to dwindle in number. It is important that those that remain are preserved as testimony of Taipei’s development history.","No. 128, Lane 155, Sec. 3, Keelung Rd., Da'an Dist., Taipei City Taiwan, R.O.C",,https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/577,

The century-old main structure was unveiled later in 1913 and is largely still preserved today, thanks to frequent restoration efforts. Initially used to house classrooms and an administrative center, the main structure grew into a national hub of medical research, a fortress of medical education reform, a site of medical humanities education and, in 2008, a museum. In addition to permanent exhibits such as “A New Born”, “The Peopling of Taiwan” and “Taiwanese People’s Struggle against Diseases”, the Museum offers special exhibits every six months to explore the impact of medical studies. It also displays exhibit items at medical education institutions nationwide. In the style of the later French Renaissance, the stately museum features graceful curves and carvings in the lobby, on the main wall and columns, with arched designs sumptuously used in the lobby and hallways for extra elegance. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in 1930 and destroyed the Mansard-style, slanted roof with slates, bronze and a little round window on top of it.

The park is divided into a Core Zone, a Buffer Zone and a Sustainable Utilization Zone, according to the type of ecological resources, in an effort to preserve and protect the natural environment with the fauna/flora habitats intact. Inaccessible to the general public, the Core Zone is a major wetland restoration site largely dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of bird habitats. The educationally-functional Buffer Zone separates the Sustainable Utilization Zone and Core Zone with hedgerows or blockade ditches; it consists of freshwater ponds, tidal ponds, aquatic plants and marsh plants, each representing a distinctive eco-system. Growing among the artificially planned and cultivated park turfs are many herbaceous and woody plants that insects feed on, while the sizeable population of invertebrates on mudflats and shoals offer perfect food for Scolopacidae and Charadriidae. Primarily designed for family recreation and bird watchers, the Sustainable Utilization Zone is installed with a duck-watching trail, a bird observatory square and a family-friendly zone, where people can enjoy outdoor activities with relatively little environmental impact. To further promote ecological education, large-scale duck- and goose-watching events are hosted in the park during the migratory-bird season, with guided tours available on weekends/holidays. The Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park, which lies beyond the embankment, and Huazhong Riverside Park, are perfect for wild bird watching; their comprehensive facilities ensure easy observation of the fascinating eco-systems.

It resembles the shape of a fish enveloped in river- or sea-water and adorned with layers of wave-like stripes, creating an incredible illusion of motion as if it were swimming ahead with ease. Some gaps in the marble create a space where the tangible mixes with the intangible, to offer a thought-provoking metaphor for the relationship between fish and water.
 
 Lin Chin-Tsung , who created “Peaceful and Content”, is a Hualien resident with inexhaustible passion for the art of stone carving. He is impressed by how the naturally occurring Hualien marble comes in varying hues with natural bands of colors, and how water erosion gives it widely distinctive shapes ranging from clouds in the sky to adorable animals on land. As a result, he started using marble to create artworks that are one of a kind. His renowned projects include: “A Fish-Shaped Landscape”, which was erected in front of the Hualien County Government building, “Fish” in the Xiao Yehliu National Scenic Area, Taitung, and “Peaceful and Content” at the intersection of Dunhua-Nanjing Roads.

It is a cross between Japanese and European architecture, with the left half including the reception room, study and dining room, featuring European-style details such as bookcases, glass bay windows, an outdoor flower bed and a porch, while the bedrooms and children’s room in the right half are covered with traditional Japanese Tatami mats. The house was taken over in 1945 by Ma Ting-ying, a professor of geology from NTU who befriended Adachi, and it officially became a city-designated historic site in 2006. In 2011, several NTU alumni rented the house from its governing body, the NTU, and the site has since been open to the public free of charge for guided tours and popular science activities.

It has well-preserved, enchanting scenic resources both in the outer and inner gardens, the principal room, the greenhouse for potted orchids, the rose garden, Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion and the Ciyun Pavilion, due to construction projects or renovations having been prohibited in the neighborhood for national security reasons. The Chinese-style inner garden is landscaped with a stream running under an artificial bridge, rock gardens, peculiarly shaped rocks, and a red-painted Chinese summerhouse, whereas the European-style outer garden with carpet bed of exuberant flowers, serves as a theme venue for the annual chrysanthemum exhibitions. The rose garden features 200 species and 4,000-odd plants with roses of varied hues during the peak blooming period from November through April, and was Madame Chiang’s favorite location for leisurely strolls. While the Chiang family was baptized in a Christian ceremony and held worship services in the Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion (aka Longevity Pavilion) is a Chinese-style quadrangular structure built in 1950 to host Mr. Chiang’s birthday celebrations; it also serves as a venue for various orchid shows. On Mt. Fushan is the Ciyun Pavilion, a two-story square summerhouse built in memory of Mr. Chiang’s mother.

They were intended for professors’ dormitories, and nestled in a kind of lushness that was unique to academia.
 After relocating from mainland China in 1949, Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong taught philosophy at Taihoku Imperial University while contributing articles of political criticism to the Free China Journal. As a man who would rather die a critic than live muted, Dr. Yin was a warrior fighting with a pen despite the rigorous censorship. He stood up bravely against the then-authoritarian regime with unbridled political criticism, exerting a strong influence on Taiwan’s progress toward democracy, as an iconic figure in the history of Chinese liberalism.
 The residence is a one-story, Japanese-style wooden structure built on a triangular base, adjacent to the other dormitories. In May 2003, the Taipei City Government designated it as a historic site that housed a significant collection of cultural assets. The Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong Foundation in November 2008 took over the operation and maintenance of the residence, recently serving as a facility for NTU’s outdoor education activities.

This park is located by the Xindian riverbank and is a neighboring park to Qingnian Park.
 
 “Machangding Memorial Park” was formerly a plot of land used for military purposes, and the Taipei City Government, through negotiations with various parties, successfully won for the right to build the “Machangding Memorial Park”. Together with the nearby Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park, they provide the Wanhua District a nice place for leisure and relaxation activities.
 
 The long stairway by the riverbank is a good place to watch the sunrise. With its wide horizon, one can see the beautiful reflection of the sun on the surface of the river. On a fine weather day, you will see the morning sun slowly rising from the side of the Taipei 101 skyscraper at a distance, with the morning rays occasionally seeping through the clouds and casting glorious reflections on the Xindian River, forming a river of gold, which is truly mesmerizing.
 
 A mound was erected in the Machangding Memorial Park, and the stele in front of the mound is inscribed with this message: “1950s marked a martial law period where hot-blooded men and righteous men who pursued social justice and political reform were arrested and executed near the Machangding mound. Machangding mound is preserved in memory of this historical event and the heroic death of the thousands who have sacrificed their lives for Taiwan.

In a pastoral public space inspired by such a natural landscape, the project enables encounters between an artwork, its geographic foundation and passengers. By assembling tens of thousands of vertical pipes into an organic, towering structure of varying heights, the designers create a rippling phenomenon spanning the elevated space by constructing a multilayered, multi-perspective visual experience. This spectacular, gigantic light sculpture reinterprets Songshan’s enthralling legacy, like flamboyant blossoms under a canopy of light.

At that time, an ancestor from Tangshan came to Taiwan alone, and resided in the cave of Tiger Mountain. He hung a red silk writing that read, “The Heavenly Emperor and various deities” by the walls of the cave entrance, and set up an incense burner on the rock to worship it. However, the cave was damaged during the Japanese colonial period. In 1954, people rebuilt a temple with bamboo at the same location to pay tribute to the Heavenly Emperor. In 1959, it was officially named “Songshan Feng Tian Temple”. From 1967 to 1977, it continued to expand, where the main hall was renovated, and a pilgrim building and library were built. With a floor area of more than 3,300m2, the place is able to accommodate more than a thousand pilgrims.

Liang moved into the house when he was appointed the Head of NTNU’s Department of English in 1952. Considering Liang’s far-reaching influence as a great educator, editor of English-Chinese dictionaries and high school English textbooks, his former residence was therefore listed among Taipei City’s cultural assets in 2003 to commemorate his standing as a paragon teacher.

504,The Installation Art Project: ‘Image of Ximen’ 「西門印象」裝置藝術,"An Interesting and Interactive Installation that Evokes Memories of the Baocheng Gate
 
 As its official Chinese name “Baocheng Gate” (寶成門) suggests, the supposedly wealth-attracting West Gate (a.k.a. “Ximen”) was a two-tier pagoda with up-tilted eaves. It was also the only one of Taipei’s five century-old citadel gateways that was demolished over time, in the early Japanese colonial period, to be precise. In an effort to reproduce the memories of the Baocheng Gate and mark the 130th Anniversary of Taipei City Walls, an installation project entitled “Impression of Ximen” was erected behind MRT Ximen Station (Exit 4) this year.
 
 By geometrically deconstructing and then reconstructing Baocheng Gate, the designer of “Impression of Ximen” combined multiple frameworks and materials of varying heights and colors to provide a fresh insight into this historically glamorous neighborhood, and eventually bridge the gap between old and new.
 
 This gateway-themed, visually intriguing project impresses people walking through or past it, not only with a unique 360-degree interplay of light and shadow, but also with fun-filled interactions achieved through an “out-of-the-box” design concept that makes art a part of everyday life.
 
 Besides the historic gateway-inspired terra cotta and gray color combination, “Impression of Ximen” features kiln-fired granite pavement that echoes the masonry wall’s grain pattern, an acrylic-encased lighting solution that lends a soft luster to the nightscape, and a shaded seating area for pedestrians. A vision of light right across from Exit 6 of the ever-crowded MRT Ximen Station, this see-through structure engages passersby in a dialogue that would hopefully bring prosperity to Ximending and Taipei’s west end alike.

An old man felt that the statue bore resemblance to Imperial Lord Wen Chang, the deity who looks after the fortune and reputation of people.

However, since the landmark was destroyed in a flood in the 6th year of Emperor Qianlong reign (1741), the locals rebuilt the temple on Zhilan Street.
 
 Shen Nong Temple was known as “Zhi Lan Temple” in the old days. Due to the fact that the people worshipped Fu De Zheng Shen (the Earth God) as the main deity, it was hence also called “Fu De Temple”. During the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, Shen Nong Emperor (also known as Emperor of the Five Grains) was established as the main deity,  the temple was hence renamed, “Shen Nong Temple”.

579,National Taiwan Arts Education Center 國立臺灣藝術教育館,"Built in March 29, 1957, the Education Center was the first public art gallery in Taiwan, and also the only government organization whose core activity is devoted solely to promoting “arts education”. Honoring the relationship of “human and art” as its establishment philosophy, the center lays the foundation of art by promoting arts education in schools; it also works with various parties in promoting aesthetic education, to “bring art to life, and bring life to art”. 
 
 The center is situated within the compound of Nanhai Academy, where many natural and cultural elements are blended beautifully together. The Center was built in the ‘50s, with a new architectural post-war Chinese classical style. The center consists of two main buildings: Nanhai Theater and Nanhai College. There are also Nanhai Outdoor Gallery and Nanhai Arts and Culture Square. The center oversees and promotes school arts education and research, as well as promotion and counselling activities. It is an important place for arts publication, learning and cultivating creative talents. 
 
 In 2006, Taipei Historical Buildings Review Committee reached a conclusion that the building (including Nanhai Theater and Nanhai College) should be considered a “historical building”. Together with the neighboring National Education Radio and National Museum of History, they form a unique group of structures within “Nanhai Academy”, preserving historical values and contributing to the beauty of the community landscape.",", Zhongzheng Dist., Taipei City Taiwan, R.O.C",Xiaonanmen,https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/681,
580,Scarecrow 稻草人,"A scarecrow protects the paddy field without fear of the wind or the rain, and battles against the birds in the sky. Birds hesitate to feed on the crops due to their fear of the humanoid scarecrow. At the channelization island on the junction of Dunhua South Road and Heping East Road stands a scarecrow made of marble. The scarecrow looks like a cube covered with lines. Through a close examination, one will discover that between the gaps of the dense lines hides a scarecrow which seems to be made of straw.
 
 The designer of this public art, Mr. Kan-Tan, explains that by putting together a simple character piece with cultural affiliation, and displaying it on a bustling city street, he hopes to make a memorable impression on the viewers.

583,Neishuangxi Nature Park 內雙溪自然公園,"Located in southeastern Shilin, the 104-hectare Neishuangxi Forest Park is the largest of its kind in Taipei City and known for the abundant ecological resources and forest landforms that gave it the reputation of “Little Xitou of Taipei”. The City’s Geotechnical Engineering Office spent a hefty sum on a renovation effort that added hiking trails, observation decks and industrial roads to the park project, which connects the Neishuangxi mountain areas in Neihu and Shilin Districts. The effort resulted in the integration of Neishuangxi woodlands, the forest park, the Bishan Campsite, the Baishihu Agricultural Community, and many other scenic and ecological resources to set local tourism in motion. 
At the entrance to the forest park, the Bixi Bridge is flanked by Formosan Tree Frogs carved out of stone to underscore the ecological diversity in “Little Xitou.” From the semicircular view deck built along bridge guardrails, visitors are treated to a visual feast of streams murmuring against a backdrop of peculiarly shaped rocks on Mt. Shitou. On the hiking trail, a 6-meter-tall, spectacular viewing platform made of 100% black sandalwood is propped up by four log columns and overlooks Dalunwei and Yuanshanzi Mountains; it is complete with a plum blossom-shaped public square at the entrance for hikers to catch their breath and take a short break. User-friendly, interactive sessions are also available at the park’s demonstration solar cell-powered system to promote energy conservation. 
The Neishuangxi Forest Park’s ecological diversity is attributable to the plentiful water resources in Bixi Catchment Area, a location where species native to the ancient Xueshan Mountain Range and the emerging Datun Mountain Range meet and highlighting the scenic beauty of various landforms. That is why the park is able to provide recreation based on a pleasant, relaxed and environmentalist lifestyle.","Lane 150, Sec. 3, Zhishan Rd., Shilin Dist., Taipei City Taiwan, R.O.C",,https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/590,

587,"Xinyi Assembly Hall, Taipei City 信義公民會館","At a corner in Taipei’s high-end Xinyi District, a few low-rise houses sit closely together. These somewhat crowded buildings chronicled the tears and joy of veterans who migrated to Taiwan in the early days. This is the former site of Taipei City’s Military Dependents’ Village, called the “Sisinan Village”.
 
 With the increasingly fast economic growth and the rising living standard, these old houses no longer serve the needs of the residents. The City Government initially planned to rebuild them in 1999. However, through persuasion from the cultural circles, the City Government designated this premise as the Cultural Hall and Cultural Park of Xinyi District, and started operation in 2003.
 
 The Hall consists of four symmetrical buildings. The houses that sat tightly next to each other have been converted into an open space for events and exhibitions. The premise now consists of an exhibition hall, Military Dependents’ Village Exhibition Hall, performance hall and community hall. The exterior still retains the unique low-rise and the simple, rustic style of the Military Dependents’ Village. The narrow alleys and footpaths will take the visitors down memory lane. It is a fascinating contrast to the neighboring towering Taipei 101 and surrounding modern buildings, a compelling testimony of Taipei’s urban development.

It was founded by U Theatre’s artistic director, Liu Ruo-Yu to practice for the Mountain Project pioneered by Jerzy Grotowski, a Polish icon of experimental theatre. This facility is expected to enable the U Theatre performers to merge drumming, meditation and Chinese martial arts in a serene setting, away from the downtown bustle. It is worth noting that the performers built their own rehearsal area by laying down the wooden structures and crossties. The Mountain Theater consists of two parts: a wooden house for the performers’ meditation sessions and drumming practices that is off-limits to visitors without reservations, and an open stage for commercial performances and rehearsals, which is open to the public.
 
 This one and only mountaintop amphitheater in Taiwan that overlooks the Taipei Basin; it attracts many hikers and sightseers even on busy weekdays. In 2007, Taipei City’s Cultural Heritage Review Committee decided to list the venue as a cultural landscape the following year for such contribution as “a culturally significant display of human-nature interactions”, “a historical, cultural, artistic or scientific value that is commemorative, representative or distinctive”, “period-specific or of social importance” and “rarity”.

593,Beitou Shibafen charcoal kiln 北投十八份木炭窯,"Charcoal was the main fuel in the old days, which was used in cooking, heating, etc. Datun mountain region has rich resources such as acacia trees, and was an excellent place for the development of the charcoal industry. It was also the means of living when the ancestors first came to this place. For example, Wu's charcoal kiln in Zhongzheng Mountain of Beitou has a history of more than 160 years. 
 
 Along Zhongzhengshan Hiking Trail (south of Datun Mountains), due to fuel requirement, the charcoal industry flourished after Taiwan retrocession, until the ‘70s. However, with the rise of the oil industry, the charcoal industry went into decline and almost disappeared from Beitou District altogether. Today, even though the charcoal industry is no longer part of the economic activity, it has been appropriately transformed into a local cultural asset. For example, within “Erqi Farm” of Beitou Farmers’ Association, there is a restored charcoal kiln which has stopped operation for 30 years. The top of the kiln is like an arched tortoise shell, and is covered with soil. A double-pitched thatched roof was constructed on top and a mono-pitched thatched roof, called “Gou-Zui-Liao-Zai” (dog mouth house), was constructed above the combustion chamber to keep away the wind and rain. The owner of the charcoal kiln at Shibafen’s farm demonstrates charcoal burning during the tour, and introduces tourists to this ancient industry.",", Beitou Dist., Taipei City Taiwan, R.O.C",,https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/682,
